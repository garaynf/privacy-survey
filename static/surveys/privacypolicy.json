This survey should take you 20-25 minutes. You will be one of about      30 participants.<br /><br />This project is unlikely to have more than      minimal risk. The study team does not foresee or anticipate any risk      greater than that encountered in your routine daily activities.<br /><br />All      of your responses will be kept anonymous beyond the demographic      questions.<br /><br />Some people who are part of this study may receive      the benefit of better understanding future privacy policies they may encounter and      changing their behavior regarding the acceptance of privacy policies. <br /><br />The study is paid for by the University of      Detroit Mercy and, therefore, there will be no cost to you aside from your      time to answer the survey      questions<br /><br />You will not be identified in any      reports on this study.
